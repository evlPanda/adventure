"i'm not lying!Really i've been writing about it already!"You realize only after you said it that it's a bad idea.
"can i see it?"she says just as you knew she would."uh...sure!let me go get my notes."You run out of the room quickly.
Once your in your room you grab a sheet of paper and start writing random stuff about a statue.-"are you coming?""yes Ziggy i'm coming!"you say.You grab the sheet and run to the room.You give the sheet to her and say "I was in a rush to go out for dinner yesterday."
