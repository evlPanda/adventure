"never mind I don't need a lift"you tell the driver.
You walk back in and start to eat."sorry Ziggy my bus wasn't here yet"you says
Ziggy looks at you in disbelief."You walk to work.I know your up to something."
She takes a pause and thinks."and as for that omelette..."she swipes it out of your hands.
"you can forget about it.I only give them to truthful people."She stares at you then when you say nothing
she walks out of the room.
